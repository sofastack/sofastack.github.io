      <title>SOFAArk control</title>

      <description>SOFAArk offers a variety of methods to support multi-application (module) consolidation and deployment, including command line-based control and API-based control. SOFAArk control is an implementation of SOFADashboard&amp;rsquo;s control over APIs. SOFAArk control is implemented by pushing commands to and parsing commands in ZooKeeper.
SOFAArk control mainly provides the following functions:
 Plug-in registration: registers the ark-biz package with SOFADashboard as basic data processors. Application association: binds the ark-biz package with host applications.</description>

      <title>SOFADashboard overview</title>
      <link>https://sofastack.github.io/sofastack.tech/en/projects/sofa-dashboard/overview/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sofastack.github.io/sofastack.tech/en/projects/sofa-dashboard/overview/</guid>
      <description>SOFADashboard is designed to implement unified management over SOFA framework components, including service governance and SOFAArk control. All technology stacks used by SOFADashboard are developed and constructed based on open-source community products, such as Ant Design Pro, SOFABoot, Spring, and MyBatis.
Currently, service governance and SOFAArk control of SOFADashboard are dependent on ZooKeeper. Therefore, you need to ensure the ZooKeeper service is available when you decide to use SOFADashboard. You also need to ensure that MySQL is available, because SOFAArk control and deployment uses MySQL for resource data storage.</description>

      <description>Version number Major, minor, and revision version numbers are used. For example, 1.0.0.
For more information, see https://semver.org/
 Major version number: All versions with the same major version number must be compatible with each other. They are not necessarily fully compatible with other major versions. However, it is best to be downward compatible. Minor version number: represents feature enhancement. The larger the version number, the more features it has.</description>
